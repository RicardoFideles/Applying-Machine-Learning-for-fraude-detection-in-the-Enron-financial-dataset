# Applying Machine Learning for fraude detection in the Enron financial dataset

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

A lot of people were investigated and were known as persons of interest (POI), individuals who somehow had any participation in the Enron fraud. The objective of this project was to create a machine learning model that through the financial data tries to identify the POI’s.

## About this Project

This study’s purpose is to use machine learning techniques to investigate and develop a model that can learn from the available data and make predictions whether or not the employee is a POI.

## Questions to be answered?

1. How many people do we have in our dataset?
2. How many features do we have ? Are they numeric or categorical ?
3. What information do we have about these people?
4. How many POIs there are in our dataset?
5. Comparing the bonus vs Salary, is there some outlier?
6. Does the data has outliers?
